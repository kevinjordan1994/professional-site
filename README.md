# Welcome to My Website!

My name is Kevin and I am a front end developer from Jacksonville, Fl. You are on the repository page for my portfolio website. I am hosting it on GitHub so you can view it [here](https://kevinjordan1994.github.io/professional-site/).

The site is mostly HTML and CSS as you can imagine but also some simple JavaScript for:

1. Dynamically calculating my age in the about section.
2. Fading in sections on scroll.
3. Lazy loading images.
4. And a carousel to showcase projects.

Please let my know if you have any feedback or if you want to work together on something. My contact info is near the bottom of the website. Thank you for stopping by!
